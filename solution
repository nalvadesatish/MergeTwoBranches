Ensure Local Branches are Up to Date:
Before merging or pushing changes, make sure your local branches are up to date with the remote repository. You can do this by running:

git fetch origin


Merge Branches:
Since you want to merge changes from master into main, ensure you are on the main branch:

git checkout main

Then, merge master into main:

git merge master

Resolve any Conflicts:
If there are conflicts during the merge, resolve them manually by editing the conflicted files, then stage and commit the changes.
Push Changes to Remote:
After merging successfully, push the changes to the remote repository:

git push origin main
Note on Remote Rejecting Push:
If you're still encountering rejection when pushing, it's likely because there are changes on the remote main branch that you don't have locally. To integrate these changes, you need to pull them into your local main branch before pushing again:


git pull origin main
After pulling, if there are any conflicts, resolve them, commit the changes, and then try pushing again.
Push Changes Again:
Once you've pulled the changes and resolved any conflicts, push your changes again:

git push origin main



After resolving conflicts (if any), commit the changes and push them to the remote repository:


git commit -m "Merge unrelated histories"
git push origin main
This should resolve the issue and allow you to merge the histories of the branches successfully
